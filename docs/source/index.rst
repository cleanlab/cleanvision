Welcome to Cleanvision's documentation!
===================================

CleanVision automatically detects various issues in image datasets, such as images
that are: (near) duplicates, blurry, over/under-exposed, etc. This data-centric AI
package is designed as a quick first step for any computer vision project to find
problems in your dataset, which you may want to address before applying machine
learning.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
