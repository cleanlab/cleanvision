Please ask questions about this library and debugging to both: 
Jonas and Yiming Chen (in Slack or via email at: <yimingc@mit.edu> <yiming.chen699@gmail.com>)

Library has rough edges since its development was abruptly halted.

Initial development should first focus on getting the library in a good state again and addressing basic code quality issues.


Two older versions of the library that may work better are:

1. the `august` branch of this repo (do not delete this branch for posterity).
2. the code in Google Drive (newer than august branch, this was final code Yiming ever touched, newer than august branch version):
