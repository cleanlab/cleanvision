Please ask questions about this library and debugging to both: 
Jonas and Yiming Chen <yimingc@mit.edu> <yiming.chen699@gmail.com>

Library may have a couple rough edges since its development was abruptly halted.

Initial development should first focus on getting the library in a good state again and addressing basic code quality issues.


Two relevant older versions of the library that should work are:

1. the `august` branch of this repo (do not delete this branch for posterity).
2. the code in Google Drive (newer than august branch, this was final code Yiming ever touched, newer than august branch version):
