<!-- Briefly summarize the issue. -->

# Stack trace

<!-- If applicable, please include a full stack trace here. If you need to omit
the bottom of the stack trace (e.g. it includes stack frames from your private
code), that is okay. Try to include all CleanVision stack frames. -->

# Steps to reproduce

<!-- Be as detailed as possible here. If possible, include a self-contained
runnable example that demonstrates the issue. Remember to supply any data
necessary to run your example, or construct your example with synthetic data.
This is not strictly required, but the more detailed your bug report, the more
quickly we can help you and fix the bug. -->

# Additional information

- **CleanVision version**: <!-- `cleanvision.__version__`, or the git commit hash if you're using an unreleased version -->
- **Operating system**: <!-- e.g. macOS 12.1, Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10 -->
- **Python version**: <!-- you can find this with `python --version` -->

<!-- Please include any other information that could be helpful for debugging. -->
