CleanVision automatically detects potential issues in image datasets like images that are: blurry, under/over-exposed, (near) duplicates, etc.
This data-centric AI package is a quick first step for any computer vision project to find problems in the dataset, which you want to address before applying machine learning.
CleanVision is super simple -- run the same couple lines of Python code to audit any image dataset!

## Installation
```shell
pip install cleanvision
```

## Quickstart

Download an example dataset (optional). Or just use any collection of image files you have.

```shell
wget -nc 'https://cleanlab-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CleanVision/image_files.zip'
```

1. Run CleanVision to audit the images.

```python
from cleanvision import Imagelab

# Specify path to folder containing the image files in your dataset
imagelab = Imagelab(data_path="FOLDER_WITH_IMAGES/")

# Automatically check for a predefined list of issues within your dataset
imagelab.find_issues()

# Produce a neat report of the issues found in your dataset
imagelab.report()
```

2. CleanVision diagnoses many types of issues, but you can also check for only specific issues.

```python
issue_types = {"dark": {}, "blurry": {}}

imagelab.find_issues(issue_types=issue_types)

# Produce a report with only the specified issue_types
imagelab.report(issue_types=issue_types)
```

## *Clean* your data for better Computer *Vision*

The quality of machine learning models hinges on the quality of the data used to train them, but it is hard to manually identify all of the low-quality data in a big dataset. CleanVision helps you automatically identify common types of data issues lurking in image datasets.

This package currently detects issues in the raw images themselves, making it a useful tool for any computer vision
task such as: classification, segmentation, object detection, pose estimation, keypoint detection, [generative modeling](https://openai.com/research/dall-e-2-pre-training-mitigations), etc.
To detect issues in the labels of your image data, you can instead
use the [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/) package.

In any collection of image files (most [formats](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) supported), CleanVision can detect the following types of issues:

|     | Issue Type       | Description                                               | Issue Key        | Example                                                                                                             |
|-----|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 3   | Blurry           | Images where details are fuzzy (out of focus)                             | blurry           | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/blurry.png)           |

| 8   | Odd Aspect Ratio | Images with an unusual aspect ratio (overly skinny/wide)            | odd_aspect_ratio | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/odd_aspect_ratio.jpg) |

This package is still a work in progress, so expect sharp edges.
