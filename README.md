# Library for auditing dataset of images for potential issues


Example collection of images you can run this library on is located here: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16wJPl8W643w7Tp2J05v3OMu8EpECkXpD?usp=share_link

After downloading these files, get started by trying to run: `examples/user_script.py`

Currently may encounter some bugs / rough edges in the library, please fix any you easily can!
